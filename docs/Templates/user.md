## Story 
so when i joined i had nothing i was begging for kits but i got nothing from players, i found some kits with gapples and swords,pics and shit like that i put it all in my ec and one day i saw a player on spawn and he was taking something out of his ec so i let him take it out and i also took out my sword from that ec and the moment he put some kit in his hands i killed him and took the kit and at the time there was item frame dupe so i insta duped it like 15 times and at the time i was using impact client cuz i was new to the anarchy and didnt know anything abt it and with my first duped kits i went on journey i wanted to build a base so i traveled abt 800k blocks from 00 and built base btw i built it on highway.
it was griefed like 2weeks after it was built because some of my mates made portal it had abt 10dubs of kits. and then somehow i got tp to like 22mil blocks from spawn by some random guy who wanted to tp trap but he didnt kill me cuz he was trash. so i set home there and went to find place for new base and i found my first base it wasnt rlly big but i was big for me abt 30dubs and many many kits i took some of them and griefed the base then i traveled like 3mil blocks and build some rlly small base and i met N64gamer124 we made some small clan and built base invited some players and we were happy but then one of the members griefed the base so we ended the clan and i was alone again i was still friend with that guy but we were not building or living together anymore and i was alone again around that time i bought elite rank at the time it was supposed to be lifetime and i met 28st on some new anarchy server made by laggang i think we became friends and then we met another guy i dont remember his name and we put shulkers on our heads and i got idea "shulker gang" and thats how sg was found and we made shulker gang big like rlly big we made some bases and then one day i had argument with lil__perp and sm guy and they wanted to kick me out of my own clan we had rlly long argument and then they nuked everything and few days later my account password got leaked and suddenly i had nothing so i decited to quit 6b6t. And now august 2024 i decited to come back to 6b6t yet not in any clan just alone guy with few kits and small base.
